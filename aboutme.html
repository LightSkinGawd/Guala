<hl>Fun Facts About Me</hl>

<p>My Mom was in the Air Force hence the moving around! Yet it made me a more adaptable person and I am truly grateful.</p>

<p>When I was 8 years old I rode my bike to fast around a corner and I collided with a dumpster that left a scar on my knee forever.</p>

<p>When I first came to this school I noticed that the dining hall food is no better than school lunches in the cafeteria!!!</p>
